### 3. About
	
I'm 37 years old. Married. I have two kids.
For the last 15 years I have been working at the plant. We service CNC ma—Åhines.
I have been studying web technologies for a year.
During this time, I studied HTML/CSS-coding.
Completed few projects as a freelancer.
But my purpose is to become a true JavaScript developer.
Now I am learning JavaScript and React.
	
### 4. Technologies, that I know
* HTML5
* CSS3 (flexbox, grid)
* SCSS
* Bootstrap (just grid)
* Git
* Adobe Photoshop and Figma
* I know a little JavaScript, jQuery and BEM.
	
### 5. Sample of code
An excerpt from my JavaScript notes.

There is a code:

```	
function foo(){
	let arr = [];

	for(var i=0; i < 3; i++){
		(function(i){
			arr[i] = () => i;
		})(i);		
	}

	return arr;
}

let next = foo();
```
When we output to the console each element of the array `console.log(next[index_of_element]());` we get 3, and not 0 1 2, as it might seem at once:

```
console.log(next[0]()); //>> 3
console.log(next[1]()); //>> 3
console.log(next[2]()); //>> 3
```

This behavior is a feature of declaring variables using var.

### 7. Education
I acquired all my knowledge on my own, reading books, manuals and watching video courses.
In the process of studying, I actively used the Internet resources [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/), as well as video courses from the [Computer Training Center "Specialist" at The Bauman Moscow State Technical University](http://en.specialist.ru/).

### 8. English level
As the test results on training.by showed, my English level is A1.
My spoken English is really bad. I need to study and practice more.
But right now I can read documentation and technical literature, also I can listen to simple podcasts.
Now I keep to improve my English. I read adapted B2-level literature, take the video course ["OK English"](https://www.youtube.com/user/elenavogni) and listening to [Teacher Luke's podcasts](https://teacherluke.co.uk/).
